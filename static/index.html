                        Functional programming as a first concern, with a modern rapidly evolving syntax.
                        Kotlin is the perfect language I have been searching for.  I love using the functional first syntax and the simplified class declarations.  It has my favourite Java features without the downsides and verbosity.
                        I absolutely love developing in Kotlin!

                        I began reluctantly coding in Java as part of a degree module, but quickly began to enjoy the simplicity and benefits of coding in such an established language.  Reading books on the 'new' streams API and functional programming techniques fuelled a fire to develop more in an immutable, data flow style.  I think Java still has much to offer.

                <p>
                    Having been a team member for my entire working
                    life, I am used to working in small teams with
                    diverse strengths and weaknesses.

                    Whilst often in a leading role within the team,
                    I'm also happy to take a back-seat, taking instructions,
                    constructively working to help the team perform well.

                <p>
                    Highly motivated by personal challenges,
                    and driven by the reward of a clean solution
                    to a difficult problem.
                    This is strengthened by being drilled within
                    the military to stop and think first -
                    planning a course of action before rushing in.

                    Known for my patience and calm friendly manner, I
                    am able to remain calm when others
                    around me are losing control, often
                    under intense time pressure.

                    Unwavering when the "perfect"
                    solution hits a stumbling block, and
                    wise enough to know that the first
                    solution was unlikely to be perfect.

                <h3>Testing First</h3>
                <p>
                    Small re-usable blocks of code minimise wastage,
                    encouraging re-use where possible,
                    as well as improving reliability, and team integration.

                    This is basis of my approach to problem-solving
                    - writing unit tests first, forcing me to analyse the
                    problem as a whole before developing a disjointed solution.
                    The tests allow for continuous refactoring and code improvements.

                <p>
                    Avoiding the pitfalls and concurrency issues associated
                    with mutating shared state, I work to minimise the
                    effect of change within applications.

                    This allows for greater concurrency, easier unit testing,
                    and therefore a more solid reliable application overall.

                        Written in Java, this started as a challenge to produce a verifier for a sudoku grid, supplied as a 2D array.
                        It was quickly developed using unit testing to provide almost instantaneous feedback on the written functions.
                        I decided to extend the project and wrote a web front end, with a backend http server that validates and sanitises requests.
                        The app also builds the html internally, allowing for dynamic grid creation.
