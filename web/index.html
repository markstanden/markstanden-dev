                        Typescript has been a
                        game-changer for me, able to write
                        type safe code in an editing
                        environment that helps you to

                        A few more build hoops to jump
                        through, but the added security
                        of the type checking - in my
                        opinion - more than makes up for
                        this.

                <h3>Team Focussed</h3>
                <p>
                    Having been a team member for my entire working
                    life, I am used to working in small teams with
                    diverse strengths and weaknesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst often in a leading role within the team,
                    I'm also happy to take a back-seat, taking instructions,
                    constructively working to help the team perform well.
                </p>

                <h3>Motivated</h3>
                <p>
                    Highly motivated by personal challenges,
                    and driven by the reward of a clean solution
                    to a difficult problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is strengthened by being drilled within
                    the military to stop and think first -
                    planning a course of action before rushing in.

                <h3>Cool Head</h3>
                <p>
                    Known for my patience and calm friendly manner, I
                    am able to remain calm when others
                    around me are losing control, often
                    under intense time pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unwavering when the "perfect"
                    solution hits a stumbling block, and
                    wise enough to know that the first
                    solution was unlikely to be perfect.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="attribute-card shadow">
                <img src="assets/icons/printer.svg" alt="">
                <h3>Testing First</h3>
                <p>
                    Small re-usable blocks of code minimise wastage,
                    encouraging re-use where possible,
                    as well as improving reliability, and team integration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is basis of my approach to problem-solving
                    - writing unit tests first, forcing me to analyse the
                    problem as a whole before developing a disjointed solution.
                    The tests allow for continuous refactoring and code improvements.

                <h3>Functional Thinking</h3>
                <p>
                    Avoiding the pitfalls and concurrency issues associated
                    with mutating shared state, I work to minimise the
                    effect of change within applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This allows for greater concurrency, easier unit testing,
                    and therefore a more solid reliable application overall.

                    Driven by the love of problem-solving,
                    researching, learning new

                        <p>
                            Written in Java, this started as a challenge to produce a verifier for a sudoku grid,
                            supplied
                            as a 2D array.
                            It was quickly developed using unit testing to provide almost instantaneous feedback on the
                            written
                            functions.
                            I decided to extend the project and wrote a web front end, with a backend http server that
                            validates
                            and sanitises requests.
                            The app also builds the html internally, allowing for dynamic grid creation.
